		title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
		subtitle: "Everything you need to know about Contextia",
		items: [
			{
				question: "How does Contextia reduce AI costs?",
				answer: "Contextia uses mathematical algorithms (BM25/TF-IDF) to intelligently select only the most relevant code context before sending it to AI models. This reduces token usage by 35-50% while maintaining 100% quality, directly translating to cost savings.",
			},
			{
				question: "Is my code data safe?",
				answer: "Absolutely. Contextia processes everything locally on your machine. Your code never leaves your computer unless you explicitly send it to an AI provider. We're privacy-first by design.",
			},
			{
				question: "Does it work with my current AI assistant?",
				answer: "Yes! Contextia is designed as a VSCode extension that works alongside your existing AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or any other tool.",
			},
			{
				question: "What's the environmental impact?",
				answer: "By reducing token usage by 35-50%, Contextia significantly decreases the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of AI queries. We provide real-time tracking of your environmental savings.",
			},
			{
				question: "How do I get started?",
				answer: "Contact us through the form above. We're currently onboarding developers and enterprise teams. You'll receive installation instructions and support within 24 hours.",
